## Array Sort

A small Ruby program written while learning about bubble sort, testing, and git.

Unit tests are run with RSpec.

Assignment:
Create a function to sort arrays. Make sure that you have tests written to show that the function works.
It may look something like this:

`ArrayHelper.sort([3, 2, 1]) # this would return [1, 2, 3]`
